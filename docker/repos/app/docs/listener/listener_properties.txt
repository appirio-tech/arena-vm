The listener.properties file should in the classpath.
This document describes the properties of the app/resources/listener.properties file.

1) useNBIO - if you use Java 1.4, you can specify whether you want to use the NBIO library or not.
If you choose not to use NBIO, then the java.nio.** classes will be used (Java 1.4).

2) numAcceptThreads, numReadThreads, numWriteThreads - you can specify the number of threads that
will process accepts (accepting new connections), reads (reading bytes from clients) and writes (writing
bytes to clients). numThreads should be greater than zero and should not be very large. The optimal
number of threads depends on the number of processors on the target machine and your benchmarks (you should
play with it).

3) bannedIPs - comma-separated list of banned IPs (in the form "X.X.X.X", 0<=X<=255)

HTTP Tunnel specific properties

4) httpListener - (true|false) Set to true if the HTTP Tunnel listener should be started along with the Listener.

5) httpListener.bindPort - The port number where the HTTP Tunnel listener will bind. 

6) httpListener.bindIp - The ip address where the HTTP Tunnel Listener will bind. empty, uses default IP.

7) httpListener.numAcceptThreads, httpListener.numReadThreads, httpListener.numWriteThreads - you can specify the number of threads that
will process accepts (accepting new connections), reads (reading bytes from clients) and writes (writing
bytes to clients). numThreads should be greater than zero and should not be very large. The optimal
number of threads depends on the number of processors on the target machine and your benchmarks (you should
play with it).

8) httpListener.bannedIPs - comma-separated list of banned IPs (in the form "X.X.X.X", 0<=X<=255)
