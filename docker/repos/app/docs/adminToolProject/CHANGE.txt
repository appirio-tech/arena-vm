Changes in Phase 3

Note: I couldn't figure out how to get the C# code to compile/run 
      and wasn't able to modify the C# files to get the C# compiler/tester
      to recognize the new requests.  I also couldn't figure out how to test
      the EJBs and just ran the AdminMonitor and tested the functionality by hand.

      Also, you'll need to add permissions to the DB to get the menu items in the
      AdminMonitor to be selectable.  Use AddFunctionPermissions.sql.
