The request forwarder works by turning the admin listener and the contest listener into clients for another listener server.  Thus, in order for it to work, the forwarding listener must be able to make a socket connection directly to the receiving listener.

The admin request forwarding, and contest listener forwarding are two separate processes.  There is a command for each one on the contest server menu in the admin monitor.
To start up the forwarding, you should simply select the appropriate dropdown's and type in the address that requests should be forwarded to as <host>:<port>

The forwarders are all separate threads, so the system should not be used with high loads.  However, because they are all separate threads, if the listener being forwarded to goes down, it will not effect the forwarding listener.
If, after starting the forwarding listener, you wish to turn it off, simple select set forwarding address from the menu, and click OK with the text field empty.  This will stop all of the forwarding threads, and disconnect them.

Because of the simplicity of the design, the forwarding must already be enabled when the user logs on, otherwise the login request will not be forwarded.  This means that when starting forwarding for the admin monitor, you will have to log out, and back in before the forwarding will be enabled.

One final note.  Because all that is happening is that the requests are being forwarded, there is some risk of the two servers getting out of synch.  So it is important that they be set up pretty much exactly the same way.
For example, if the room_ids are out of synch on the two servers, then when someone tries to move to their room, they will go to the wrong room on the server being forwarded to.  While this will not effect the person at all, it will prevent things from working on the server being forwarded to.
