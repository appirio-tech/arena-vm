to add/edit lobbies, one must simply edit the room table in the DB.

To add a lobby, simply add a new room to the database with round_id == 0, and room_id between 10 and 19 inclusive.  To set a capacity on the lobby room, set the room_limit field.  If this is not set, or is set to -1 or 0, the capacity is assumed to be unlimited.
The name field will also be used as the name of the lobby to be used in the lobbies menu.
The room_type should be 5, which should by in the room_type table.

The admin lobby is hard coded to by room_id == 0.  Thus, this room should be in the DB, with round_id = 0.  Other than the chat features, it behaves pretty much just like any lobby.  The room_limit and name fields are still used.

The assignment of users to lobbies on initial login is done by putting users in the lobby with some room_limit that has the lowest percent full.  Thus, users will never be put into unlimited lobbies on initial login, but may move there at any time.  
Admins are put in the admin lobby on login.
