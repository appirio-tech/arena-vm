CoreServices (com.topcoder.server.services.CoreServices)

This class primary serves as the abstraction layer for data persistance and retrieval
from the database.  It consists entirely of static functions so it can be used from
anywhere.  Basically it wraps the DBServicesBean to provide a cleaner easier way to
get our objects.  It also helps maintain all the runtime objects, i.e. ActiveContests,
LeaderBoard, ContestRoom status.

On listener startup start() is called so all the proper information can be loaded, i.e.
practice rooms being pre loaded, initializing stuff from the database like user names -> ids.

Most of the methods are pretty self descriptive from their names, there are a few functions
which probably should be moved to processor since they contain some strange API which is
very processor specific (i.e. getProblem(userID, index)).
