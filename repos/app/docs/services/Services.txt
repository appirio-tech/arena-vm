CompileService (com.topcoder.server.services.CompileService)

This class abstracts how we send compile messages.  Right now it basically just handles posting
JMS messages.  It should be easy to change this to another protocol later without influencing
any other parts of the system (from the request side).

TestService is similar but for test/challenges.
