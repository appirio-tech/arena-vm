EJB Server - JBoss 2.4.4

1) Install JBoss, i.e. unpack it, e.g. to c:\JBoss-2.4.4
2) Copy to the lib/ext folder (e.g. c:\JBoss-2.4.4\lib\ext) your JDBC driver jar file (e.g. mm.mysql-2.0.13-bin.jar)
3) Point app/build.xml's ejb.deploy.dir property to the deploy dir, e.g. c:\JBoss-2.4.4\deploy
Note that JBoss has auto-(re)deploy feature. You just need to copy (over) the the proper ejb jar file 
(along with descriptors) to the deploy dir. Auto redeploying worked quite well for me.
4) Make changes in ApplicationServer.properties. Make sure that properties
EJB_SERVER_URL and EJB_JNDI_FACTORY are properly set.  

=========================
DB - MySQL 3.23.49

1) If you use MM MySQL JDBC Driver make sure you use version 2.0.12 (04/09/2002) or later.
I work with 2.0.13 (04/24/2002).
2) Install MySQL.
3) Use the script app/scripts/mysql/create_db.sql (e.g. by "mysql < create_db.sql"). 
4) Specify properties tables and sequences in app/resources/CreateLocalDb.properties.
The values for tables and sequences should be one line, comma-delimited.
5) Use "ant create-local-db". Comment:
Load the data from the Informix dev db to your local MySQL db. It could be long (around 6-7 hours for loading
of approx. 400Mb for me, I have cable connection). It's very possible that it's not necessary to load
everything. I loaded everything just in case and without spending time figuring out what to load.
6) Use the script app/scripts/mysql/seq.sql
7) Make changes in DBMS.properties. Make sure that properties
JDBC_DRIVER and DB are properly set.

=========================
Windows Notes

1) Make sure that you installed nbio-win32 (at this moment the current version is nbio-win32-beta-0.5).

=========================
JMS

1) I had different problems with all open-source JMS implementations I tried. If you know the implementation
that works with TopCoder JMS code, please let me know.
2) The current version just does the very minimum. I plan to make it work when you have the listener server,
compiler server and tester server on one machine. I'm almost there (translation: don't try now compiling and
testing).

=========================
Startup procedure

1) Start JBoss server (e.g. run "run.bat" in c:\JBoss-2.4.4\bin). Ctrl-C to stop it.
2) If you want to use contest simulation, run "ant run-contest-simulation-db-update".
It creates (overwrites) a contest. See com.topcoder.utilities.contest_sim.ContestSimulationDbUpdate.
For now you can change constants there, later it will be moved to some resource files.
3) Start the listener server (run "listener.bat" in app/scripts).
4) If you want to use contest simulation, run "ant run-contest-simulation" (wait till the listener
server is up and running). For now it can automatically start the timer, have some bots log in,
have them register, run assignments, run systests, run endcontest, have bots log out.
