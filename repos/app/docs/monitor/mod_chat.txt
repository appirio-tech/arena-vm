1) One possible issue with dbs is round_type_lu values should match values in ContestConstants.
(e.g. moderated should be 5).

2) When you create the contest, start date should be in the past and the end date should be far in the future.

3) For the invite_list you can use register_user but it only affects the runtime. But if you insert it manually
in the db, it will be loaded.
