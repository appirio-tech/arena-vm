1) The following update should be executed:

INSERT INTO round_type_lu (round_type_id, round_type_desc) VALUES (11, 'Weakest Link Round')

2) Before the weakest link first round is started, it's expected that wl_team and wl_coder tables are created
(e.g. see the commented fragment in the build.xml, sql task) and populated (e.g. see the commented fragment in the build.xml,
mysql task).

wl_team: CREATE TABLE wl_team (team_id INT PRIMARY KEY, team_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE);

wl_coder: CREATE TABLE wl_coder (round_id INT, coder_id INT, team_id INT, points_sum DECIMAL(4,2), qual_points DECIMAL(5,3),
                room_no INT, badge_id VARCHAR(128));

points_sum should be zero (will be used in the next rounds), qual_points should could contain any numbers (the data from
the qual round), will be used for breaking ties (the bigger the number the better).

For the first round room assignment, make sure room_no has the needed value (one-based, starting with 1).

3) It is expected that only division one problems are used since there are no divisions.

4) After the contest to prepare the data for the next weakest link round, use
"Run contest->After contest->Advance Weakest Link Coders...". Provide the next round id.

5) Compete by IP address. Set Processor.props, processor.weakestLinkIPPrefix.

6) For qual rounds you need to populate the wl_coder table in order to have IP checking and badge id storing. Note that you don't
need to register coders, it will be done automatically at the load time.
