For Windows use monitor_gui.bat
For Linux use monitor_gui.sh

log4j classes should be in CLASSPATH.

You can specify multiple command-line arguments.
Each argument should have the following form: "host:port",
where the host is the server running TopCoder AppServer
(including the listener component) and the port is the port
on which the listener component waits for admin monitor
clients (not applet clients!).

For example,

monitor_gui.bat coder.topcoder.com:5010
monitor_gui.sh  coder.topcoder.com:5010
