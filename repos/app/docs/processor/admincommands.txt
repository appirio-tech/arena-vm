All admin commands must be prefixed with "/admin" (quotes unnecessary) in
the applet chat window.  Only users with the admin flag set will be allowed
to execute the commands and others will just have the commands treated as
normal chat requests.  If required arguments (indicated between '<' '>') are
missing, then the command will be ignored.

systest [coderID] [problemID] [isFailOnFirstBadTest]
    Runs the system test for the active contest.
    Optional arguments.
    specify coderID>0 if you want to run system tests just for this coder.
    specify problemID>0 if you want to run system tests just for this problem.
    isFailOnFirstBadTest (by default true)

phase [phase id]
    Sets the phase of the active contest to the indicate phase (the IDs
    correspond to the phase IDs in ContestConstants).  If no phase id
    is present, then the phase is incremented by one.

refreshreg
    invokes the CoreServices.refreshRegistration API. Primarily intended
    for debugging purposes.

timer
    Starts a timer thread for contest phase changes.

rooms <starting roomID> [coders per room] [IronMan] [byDivision] [isFinal] [isByRegion]
    Creates the contest rooms for the active contest.  The optional
    arguments must be in the order given.  The coders per room defaults
    to the RoomAssigner.DEFAULT_CODERS_PER_ROOM constant (10) and
    the three boolean flags default to true.  IronMan indicates if the
    rooms should be assigned IronMan style or classic.  ByDivision indicates
    if there should be a breakdown by division (this flag is ignored for
    IronMan room assignment).  The isFinal flag indicates if the new room
    data should be persisted to the database.

    If isByRegion==true, then coders will be separated by region (classic style).
    Only startingRoom, codersPerRoom and isFinal parameters are taken into account, others are ignored.
    If isFinal==false, then it will only print out room assignments without updating db.

refresh <round id>
    Reloads the given contest round from the database.

refreshprobs <round id>
    Reloads the problems for the given round from the database.

refreshroom <room id>
    Reloads the given room id from the database.

refreshbroadcasts
    Reloads admin broadcast cache from the last three hours from the database.
    Does not notify users of new broadcasts until they open up the broadcast
    window in the client.

addtime <minutes> <seconds> <phase> <add to start>
    Adds the given time to a phase.  If the fourth argument is present
    the time is also added to the start of the phase (doesn't matter
    what the argument is).

create <round id>
    Creates a new contest with the given ID. Intended for debugging only.

restore <round id>
    Loads in the given round id as the active contest.

next
    Sets the next contest as the Active Contest.  Primarily intended for
    debugging

broadcast <type> [<id>] <message>
    Sends an admin system message.
    <type> is one of:
        global: Broadcast to all users logged in to the system.
        round: Broadcast to all users registered for the specified contest
            round.  Specify the numerical round ID in the <id> position.
        problem: Broadcast to all users registered for the current round
            about a specific problem, problem ID in the <id> field.  The
            broadcast will have problem information attached by the system.
            The problem must be one of the problems used in the active
            contest.

endcontest
    Invokes the end contest logic for the active contest.

gc
    Runs garbage collection on the server and reports back the results.

setuserstatus <username> <status>

    Changes the user's status in the user db table. Status could be either
    'A' (active) or 'I' (inactive). If the status is inactive the user will
    not be able to log in to the system.

cleartestcases

    Clears test cases at the listener side. For now it means clearing 
    test cases for C#.
