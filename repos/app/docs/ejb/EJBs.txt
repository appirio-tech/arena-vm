DBServicesBean (com.topcoder.server.ejb.DBServicesBean/TestServicsBean)

This class handles all the object persistance.  Basically all of its functions are
just to fetch our objects from the database, or execute some contest function.

It should be relatively simple to use with no real tricks, keep in mind that CoreServices
are local to your JVM so calls to CoreServices in the Beans in general won't affect
CoreServices on other JVM's (i.e. the listeners)

TestServicesBean

This class contains all the methods necessary for testing/compiling/challenges.  Its a
tough call deciding whether to split all the database code up into different beans since
exporting each bean is a signifigant hit on the development/test cycle.  I'd suggest
development/testing with code in as few beans as possible and then moving them into different
beans once the kinks are worked out if you are so inclined.
