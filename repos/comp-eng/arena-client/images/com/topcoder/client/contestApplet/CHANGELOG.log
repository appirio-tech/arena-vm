                       If you want to use double quotes within strings,
                       they must be preceded by a backslash.
                       '{', and '}' will be trimmed off the end of the string
                       The text will be tokenized using whitespace and commas
                       that are not within quotes as delimeters.
                       Thus, if you want to enter a string with spaces, 
                       or commas, it must be surrounded by quotes.
