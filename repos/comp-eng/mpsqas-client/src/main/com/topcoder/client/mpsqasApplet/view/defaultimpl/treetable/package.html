Classes for a TreeTable, which is like a JTree except each node can contain several columns
of data.  This package contains the required interfaces for the TreeTableModel and default
implementations of it.  Much of this code was borrowed from Sun Microsystems' Philip Milne and Scott Violet.  Their code can be found at <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/treetable1/index.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/treetable1/index.html</a>.
